### Full Description (for product page, optimized for keywords + conversion)

**Do you struggle to say no without feeling guilty?**

If you're a people pleaser, over-functioner, or chronic "yes" person, you already know the cost: exhaustion, resentment, and relationships built on your compliance rather than your authenticity.

**Boundaries Without Guilt** is your practical, research-backed guide to setting boundaries that protect your time, energy, and relationships—without the guilt spiral that usually follows.

**What makes this book different:**

✓ **Real scripts you can use immediately** – No vague advice. Get word-for-word phrases for declining meetings, handling family guilt, and navigating workplace pressure.

✓ **Research-backed strategies** – Drawing on cognitive psychology, attachment theory, and communication science, you'll understand why guilt misfires and how to recalibrate.

✓ **Covers real-world power dynamics** – Specific guidance for workplace hierarchies, family systems, client relationships, and even situations where saying no isn't safe.

✓ **Signature tools that stick** – Master the Pause-Label-Let method, Boundary Breath, and Repair without Retracting framework.

**What you'll learn:**

- How to distinguish between values-based boundaries and guilt-driven compliance
- The four types of boundaries everyone needs (time, task, talk, touch)
- Scripts for unequal power dynamics (boss, client, professor, family)
- How to exit family drama triangles without coldness
- Strategic alternatives when direct boundaries aren't safe
- How to repair messy boundaries without retracting them

**Perfect for:**
- People pleasers tired of saying yes to everything
- Over-functioners carrying everyone else's responsibilities
- Anyone who feels guilty after setting boundaries
- Professionals navigating workplace boundary challenges
- Family members stuck in mediator roles
- Anyone rebuilding relationships after codependency

**If you've ever:**
- Canceled your own plans to accommodate someone else
- Stayed up all night replaying a conversation where you said no
- Taken on tasks you didn't have time for because you felt guilty refusing
- Wondered why you can't just be "nicer" about boundaries

...this book is for you.

Stop apologizing for having needs. Start setting boundaries without guilt.
