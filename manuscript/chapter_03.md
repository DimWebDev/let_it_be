# Chapter 3: Scripts for Unequal Power

## Workplace Hierarchies

### The Overloaded Employee

Maya stared at the calendar notification. Thursday at 4:47 p.m. The subject line read: "Quick weekend project—need your eyes on this ASAP." Her manager, Derek, had attached a forty-page deck with a note: "Client wants revisions Monday morning. Can you knock this out over the weekend? Shouldn't take more than a few hours."

Maya had been at the company for eight months. Derek had hired her. Derek wrote her performance reviews. Derek decided if she got the promotion she'd been quietly hoping for.

She felt her chest tighten. She had plans—her sister was visiting from out of state, the first time they'd seen each other in a year. But the phrase "shouldn't take more than a few hours" echoed in her mind. *What if it does take hours? What if I say no and he thinks I'm not committed? What if this is a test?*

She typed three different responses. Deleted all of them. Paused with her cursor hovering over "Reply."

Finally, she wrote: "Sure, I'll take a look."

By Sunday night, she'd spent eleven hours revising the deck. Her sister had left that afternoon, disappointed. Maya told herself it was fine. *This is what it takes to get ahead.*

But Monday morning, Derek glanced at the revised deck and said, "Oh, the client moved the meeting to next week. No rush after all."

Maya smiled. Nodded. Went back to her desk and felt something crack inside.

### Why Workplace Power Magnifies Guilt

You've probably been Maya. Maybe not with a weekend project, but with a meeting you didn't want to attend, a task that wasn't yours to own, or an email sent at 9 p.m. that you felt obligated to answer by 9:15.

When someone above you in a hierarchy makes a request, your body reads it differently than a peer's ask. Your nervous system registers the power imbalance. You're not just weighing whether you have time—you're calculating risk. *Will saying no cost me opportunity? Safety? Respect?*

Research on psychological safety, a term coined by Harvard professor Amy Edmondson, shows that employees are far less likely to speak up, push back, or set boundaries when they perceive that doing so could harm their standing. In workplaces where hierarchy is rigid and feedback flows only downward, people learn to suppress their needs. The cost isn't just personal—it's organizational. Teams lose creativity, honesty, and resilience when people can't say, "I don't have capacity for this."

But here's what makes workplace boundaries especially hard: the guilt isn't just about disappointing someone. It's tangled with survival instinct. Your paycheck depends on this relationship. Your career trajectory lives in this person's perception of you. So when Derek sends that Thursday email, your brain doesn't just think, *Do I want to do this?* It thinks, *Can I afford not to?*

And that's not guilt. That's fear dressed up as obligation.

The good news: you can set boundaries upward without torching your reputation. You just need language that balances respect with clarity—and a script that doesn't require you to apologize for having limits.

---

### The Anatomy of Upward Boundaries

Workplace boundaries aren't about defiance. They're about sustainable contribution. You can't perform well if you're perpetually overloaded. You can't build trust if you silently resent every request. And you can't grow if you never negotiate your workload.

Here's the framework: upward boundaries work best when they're framed around **prioritization, not refusal**. Instead of "I can't do this," try "To do this well, I'll need to deprioritize X. How should I proceed?"

This does two things. First, it shifts the conversation from *your capacity* to *shared decision-making*. You're not saying no—you're asking your manager to help you allocate resources wisely. Second, it demonstrates that you're thinking strategically, not reactively. You're protecting the quality of your work, not avoiding effort.

Let's look at how Maya could have responded differently.

### Script Deck: Communicating Upward with Clarity

**Scenario 1: The Last-Minute Weekend Request**

> *"Thanks for sending this over. I want to make sure I give it the attention it deserves. I have a family commitment this weekend that I can't move, but I can prioritize this first thing Monday morning and have revisions to you by end of day. Does that work, or is there a hard Monday deadline I should know about?"*

**Why this works:** You're not apologizing. You're not justifying why your weekend matters. You're offering a realistic alternative and checking whether the urgency is real or assumed.

**Scenario 2: Too Many Priorities**

> *"I'm currently working on the Q4 report, the client presentation, and the team training rollout. If I take on this new project, something will need to shift. Can we talk through what should take priority?"*

**Why this works:** You're making your workload visible. Many managers don't track every task on your plate. This invites collaboration instead of resentment.

**Scenario 3: Unclear Scope**

> *"Before I commit to this, can you help me understand the scope? I want to make sure I'm budgeting the right amount of time and not under-promising."*

**Why this works:** You're asking for clarity, which protects both you and your manager from misaligned expectations. It signals professionalism, not resistance.

**Scenario 4: Repeated Pattern of Overload**

> *"I've noticed I've been asked to cover several last-minute projects in the past month. I want to be a reliable team member, and I also want to make sure I'm not stretched so thin that quality suffers. Can we schedule a time to talk about workload distribution?"*

**Why this works:** You're naming the pattern without accusation. You're framing it as a shared problem to solve, not a complaint.

---

### The Boundary Breath for High-Stakes Moments

Before you send that email or enter that conversation, try this:

**Pause.** Take three slow breaths. Notice where you feel tension—jaw, shoulders, stomach.

**Label.** Name what you're feeling. *I'm afraid of disappointing Derek. I'm worried about my promotion. I'm angry that this keeps happening.*

**Let.** Let the feeling exist without immediately acting on it. You don't have to like the feeling. You just have to stop letting it write your response.

This micro-practice, which we call the **Boundary Breath**, gives you just enough space to choose your words instead of reacting from fear or guilt.

---

### What If They React Badly?

Here's the hard truth: some managers will respect boundaries. Others won't. If you work in a psychologically unsafe environment, setting boundaries may carry real risk. (We'll talk more about when "no" isn't safe in Chapter 5.)

But in many cases, the reaction you fear doesn't materialize. You imagine fury; you get a calm "No problem, Monday works." You imagine career damage; you get respect for managing your workload proactively.

And even if the reaction is frustration, you've done something crucial: you've signaled that you have limits. Over time, people stop testing boundaries they know are firm.

One last thing: if you set a boundary and then feel the pull to apologize, soften, or retract it—pause. That's the guilt alarm again. It's not guidance. It's static.

You don't owe an apology for protecting your time, your energy, or your wellbeing. You owe clarity, respect, and follow-through. And you just delivered all three.

**Reflection:**
Think of one workplace request you accepted in the past month that you wish you'd declined. What would you say differently now, using the prioritization language above?

## Client and Service Provider Dynamics

### The Freelancer and the Scope Creep

Jared had been freelancing as a graphic designer for three years. He'd learned to navigate late payments, vague feedback, and clients who thought "just one more tiny tweak" meant another full day of revisions. But his current client, a startup founder named Alicia, was different. She paid on time. She gave clear feedback. She sent thank-you notes.

So when Alicia emailed him halfway through a branding project with a new request—"Can you also design the investor deck slides? It'll use the same visual language, so it should be quick"—Jared hesitated for only a moment before replying: "Sure, happy to help."

The deck wasn't quick. It required custom icons, charts, and fifteen rounds of revisions as Alicia's co-founder weighed in. By the time Jared finished, he'd worked an additional twenty hours beyond the original contract. He hadn't invoiced for any of it.

When he finally sent a gentle email asking if they could adjust the scope and fee, Alicia's response was swift: "I thought we had a good partnership here. This feels nickel-and-dime-y. I'm disappointed."

Jared stared at the screen. His chest felt tight. He thought about the referrals Alicia had promised. He thought about his bank account, which was tighter than he wanted to admit. He thought about how hard it was to find clients who actually valued design work.

He wrote back: "You're right, let's keep it as is."

He closed his laptop and wondered why doing the right thing—saying yes, being helpful, going the extra mile—always seemed to leave him feeling used.

---

### The Economics of Fear

If you've ever worked as a freelancer, contractor, consultant, or small business owner, you know this feeling. The client-provider relationship is built on unequal footing. They hold the money. You hold the skills. And in that exchange, there's always the quiet question: *What if I lose them?*

Behavioral economics calls this **loss aversion**—the principle that losing something feels worse than gaining something of equal value feels good. For freelancers, the potential loss of a client doesn't just mean lost income. It means lost referrals, lost credibility, and the exhausting task of finding new work. So when a client pushes past agreed-upon boundaries, your brain calculates risk in real time: *Is it worth it to push back?*

The answer, too often, is no. You absorb the extra work. You swallow the resentment. You tell yourself it's the cost of doing business.

But here's what research on fairness and reciprocity shows: clients who respect boundaries are more likely to become long-term, high-value partners. Clients who don't respect boundaries rarely get better over time. If Alicia frames a reasonable scope conversation as "nickel-and-dime-y," she's telling you something important about how she views the relationship. And it's not partnership—it's extraction.

You don't have to accept that. You just need language that protects your work, your worth, and your capacity to say, "That's outside our agreement."

---

### Anchoring Boundaries in Clarity, Not Apology

Scope creep happens when boundaries aren't visible. If a contract says "branding package" without defining deliverables, every additional request feels ambiguous. Is this part of the package, or not? Clients don't always know. And if you're not clear, they'll assume the answer is yes.

The solution: **anchor every boundary in shared agreement**. Instead of "I can't do that," say "That's outside the scope we agreed on. I'm happy to add it with an updated proposal."

This does two things. First, it removes emotion from the conversation. You're not rejecting the client—you're referencing a document both of you signed. Second, it signals professionalism. You're treating this like a business transaction, because it is one.

Let's look at how Jared could have responded differently when Alicia first asked for the investor deck.

---

### Script Deck: Managing Scope and Saying No with Grace

**Scenario 1: The Surprise Add-On Request**

> *"Thanks for thinking of me for the investor deck! That's outside the scope of our current branding agreement, but I'd be happy to put together a proposal for it. I can get that to you by end of week so you can decide if it fits your budget and timeline."*

**Why this works:** You're saying yes to the relationship, not the request. You're offering a path forward that respects your time and expertise.

**Scenario 2: The "Just One More Thing" Request**

> *"I want to make sure I'm delivering quality work, and adding this will require more time than I have available within the current scope. If this is a priority, I can either adjust the timeline or we can discuss adding it as a separate deliverable. Which works better for you?"*

**Why this works:** You're framing it as a trade-off, not a refusal. You're giving the client agency while protecting your capacity.

**Scenario 3: The Client Who Pushes Back on Boundaries**

> *"I understand this might feel frustrating. My goal is to make sure I'm doing great work for you without overextending in a way that compromises quality. The deliverables we agreed on are [list]. If priorities have shifted, I'm happy to revisit the scope and adjust the contract."*

**Why this works:** You're validating their frustration without caving. You're reaffirming the original agreement and offering a clear path to renegotiate.

**Scenario 4: Declining Future Work from a Boundary-Crossing Client**

> *"I appreciate you thinking of me for this project. After reflecting on our last collaboration, I don't think I'm the right fit for this one. I'm happy to refer you to another designer who might be a better match."*

**Why this works:** You're ending the relationship without burning the bridge. You're asserting your worth without needing to justify it.

### Email Template: Renegotiating Scope Mid-Project

When scope creep has already happened and you need to reset expectations, use this structure:

**Subject:** Scope Adjustment for [Project Name]

> Hi [Client Name],
>
> I've loved working on [original deliverables] with you. As we've moved through the project, a few additional requests have come up that fall outside our original agreement: [list specific items].
>
> I want to make sure I'm delivering the quality you expect, and I also want to be transparent about scope. Here are two options:
>
> 1. I can complete the original deliverables as planned by [original deadline].
> 2. I can incorporate the additional requests with an adjusted timeline and fee. I've attached a revised proposal for your review.
>
> Let me know which approach works best for you. I'm committed to making this a great outcome either way.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

**Why this works:** You're not blaming. You're not apologizing. You're offering clarity and choice. You're treating this as a professional negotiation, not a conflict.

---

### The Pause-Label-Let for Financial Fear

Before you reply to a scope-pushing email, try this:

**Pause.** Take three breaths. Notice the fear in your body. Where do you feel it? Chest? Throat? Stomach?

**Label.** Name it. *I'm afraid of losing this client. I'm afraid of seeming difficult. I'm afraid I won't find another client this good.*

**Let.** Let the fear exist. You don't have to act on it. Fear is information, not instruction. You can feel afraid and still protect your boundaries.

This is **Pause-Label-Let**, the signature tool we introduced in Chapter 1. It works for managers, and it works for clients. The fear is real. The boundary can be, too.

---

### When to Walk Away

Some clients will respect a scope conversation. Others will frame it as betrayal. If a client responds to a reasonable boundary with guilt, manipulation, or threats, that's not a partnership—it's a warning sign.

You don't owe loyalty to someone who doesn't respect your work. You don't owe discounted labor to someone who sees you as interchangeable. And you don't owe your livelihood to someone who punishes you for having limits.

Walking away is hard. But staying in a relationship built on resentment is harder.

One last thing: if you find yourself pre-emptively doing extra work to avoid a scope conversation, pause. That's guilt talking. That's the belief that your value is contingent on over-delivering. It's not. Your value is in the work you agreed to do, done well. That's enough.

**Reflection:**
Think of one client or customer interaction where you absorbed extra work without renegotiating scope. What would you say now, using the scripts above?

## Academic and Institutional Power

### The Student and the Unpaid Research

Lena sat in her professor's office, trying to look grateful. Dr. Navarro had just offered her a "unique opportunity"—assisting with his research project over winter break. No pay, but "invaluable experience" and "a strong letter of recommendation" when she applied to grad school next year.

Lena was a junior. She needed the letter. Dr. Navarro taught the only advanced seminar in her major, and he was well-connected in her field. Saying no felt impossible.

But winter break was the only time she worked full shifts at the restaurant that paid her rent. Her financial aid didn't cover housing during breaks. She'd already calculated that if she skipped those shifts, she'd start spring semester behind on bills.

She opened her mouth to explain. Then she saw Dr. Navarro's expression—expectant, slightly impatient, already moving on to the next thing. She imagined him thinking she wasn't serious about her education. She imagined the letter she wouldn't get. She imagined her grad school applications without his name attached.

"That sounds great," she said. "I'd love to help."

By January, she was two months behind on rent.

---

### The Weight of Authority Bias

Academic institutions run on a specific kind of power: the power of gatekeeping. Professors control grades, letters of recommendation, research opportunities, and access to professional networks. For students, especially those without family wealth or connections, that power isn't abstract—it's material. It shapes your transcript, your future, your economic stability.

This creates what psychologists call **authority bias**—the tendency to comply with requests from authority figures even when those requests are unfair, unreasonable, or harmful. Research shows that people are far more likely to say yes to someone in a position of power, not because they want to, but because the cost of refusal feels too high.

For Lena, saying no to Dr. Navarro isn't just about declining a project. It's about risking her academic future. And that risk is real. In systems where power is concentrated and feedback is one-directional, students learn quickly that boundaries are punished, not respected.

But here's the truth that institutions don't often say out loud: **unpaid labor dressed up as opportunity is still exploitation.** If the work has value—if it contributes to research, publications, or institutional prestige—it deserves compensation. A letter of recommendation is not payment. It's a professional courtesy that should be freely given to students who earn it through their academic work, not through free labor.

You don't have to accept the frame that saying no makes you ungrateful or uncommitted. You can negotiate. You can ask questions. You can assert your needs without sacrificing respect. You just need language that balances deference with clarity.

---

### Negotiating with Authority Without Burning Bridges

Academic boundaries are tricky because the relationship isn't just professional—it's evaluative. Your professor doesn't just assign you work; they assign you grades. So when you set a boundary, you're not just protecting your time—you're navigating a power structure that may not reward honesty.

The key: **frame your boundary as a question, not a refusal.** Instead of "I can't do this," try "I'd like to understand the scope and timeline so I can assess whether I can commit to doing it well."

This does two things. First, it signals respect for the opportunity while creating space to decline. Second, it shifts the burden of clarity onto the person making the request. If Dr. Navarro can't articulate the scope, timeline, and learning outcomes of the project, that's information. It suggests the opportunity may not be as structured—or as valuable—as it initially seemed.

Let's look at how Lena could have responded when Dr. Navarro first made the offer.

---

### Script Deck: Asserting Boundaries in Academic Settings

**Scenario 1: The Unpaid Research Opportunity**

> *"Thank you so much for thinking of me for this project. Before I commit, can I ask a few questions? What would the time commitment look like week to week? Are there any learning outcomes or skills I'd be developing? And is there funding or course credit available for student research assistants?"*

**Why this works:** You're not saying no. You're gathering information. If the answer is "20 hours a week, no pay, no credit," you now have clarity to make a decision.

**Scenario 2: The Overloaded Course Workload**

> *"I want to make sure I'm giving this course the attention it deserves. I'm currently enrolled in 18 credits and working part-time. Is there any flexibility in the deadline for the final project, or would you recommend I adjust my course load?"*

**Why this works:** You're naming your capacity and asking for guidance. This invites collaboration instead of appearing as a complaint.

**Scenario 3: The Request That Conflicts with Paid Work**

> *"I'm really interested in this opportunity, but I have work commitments during winter break that I can't move. Is there a way to structure the research project around a different timeline, or would it make sense for me to participate in a future project instead?"*

**Why this works:** You're protecting your livelihood without dismissing the offer. You're proposing alternatives that might work for both parties.

**Scenario 4: The Guilt-Inducing Follow-Up**

> *"I appreciate your understanding that I'm not able to take this on right now. I'm committed to succeeding in your course and in my major, and I want to make sure I'm managing my time in a way that lets me do my best work."*

**Why this works:** You're reaffirming your commitment to your education without caving to pressure. You're framing the boundary as a form of responsibility, not avoidance.

---

### When Institutional Power Requires Strategic Compliance

Here's the hard part: not all academic boundaries are safe to assert. If you're in a program where one professor controls your entire trajectory, if you're an international student whose visa depends on good standing, or if you're navigating systemic bias that already puts you at risk—direct refusal may carry consequences you can't afford.

In those cases, strategic compliance isn't weakness. It's survival. You do what you need to do to get through. And when you're out, you remember. You advocate for students in similar positions. You push for systemic change. You refuse to replicate the harm.

But if you do have some leverage—if there are multiple faculty members, if there's an ombudsperson, if there's institutional support for student workers—use it. Ask about funding. Request course credit. Seek clarity on scope. Name the pattern if it's happening to multiple students.

Boundaries in unequal power dynamics aren't always about saying no. Sometimes they're about asking better questions. Sometimes they're about naming what's invisible. Sometimes they're about refusing to accept exploitation as mentorship.

---

### The Boundary Breath for Institutional Pressure

Before you respond to a professor, advisor, or administrator, try this:

**Pause.** Take three slow breaths. Notice the tightness in your chest or throat.

**Label.** Name what you're feeling. *I'm afraid of disappointing them. I'm worried about my grade. I'm angry that this is even being asked.*

**Let.** Let the feeling be there. You don't have to resolve it. You don't have to act on it. You just have to stop letting it dictate your response.

This is the **Boundary Breath** again. It works in job interviews, client calls, and academic offices. The power imbalance is real. Your right to think before answering is real, too.

---

### Respect Is Not the Same as Compliance

You can respect someone's expertise, authority, and position without agreeing to every request they make. Respect is about how you communicate, not whether you comply.

Saying "I need to think about this and get back to you" is respectful. Saying "I can't take this on, but I appreciate you thinking of me" is respectful. Saying "Can we talk about compensation or credit for this work?" is respectful.

What's disrespectful is asking students to work for free and framing refusal as lack of commitment. What's disrespectful is leveraging your power to pressure compliance. What's disrespectful is building institutional success on the backs of unpaid labor.

You don't owe deference to systems that exploit you. You owe yourself clarity, honesty, and the refusal to internalize someone else's entitlement as your obligation.

One last thing: if you set a boundary in an academic setting and face retaliation—grade penalties, withheld letters, exclusion from opportunities—document it. Talk to an advisor, ombudsperson, or dean of students. You may not feel powerful, but you have more recourse than you think. And you deserve to learn in an environment where boundaries are respected, not punished.

---

**Reflection:**
Think of one academic or institutional request you agreed to that cost you more than it should have. What question could you have asked to protect yourself while staying respectful?
