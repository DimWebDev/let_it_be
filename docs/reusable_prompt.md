### Project Context

You are drafting content for the book *Let It Be, Let Me Be: Boundaries Without Guilt*.

Reference materials:

* `docs/Project_Metadata.md` (defines genre, audience, stylistic expectations, and meaning of Genre Artifacts)
* `docs/Outline.md` (chapter-by-chapter and section-by-section structure, with artifacts and beats)
* `docs/Guidelines.md` (tone, POV, pacing, word count, style checks)
* `docs/Backlog.md` (production roadmap and drafting prompts for every section and artifact)

---

### Instructions

* Draft **only** the segment provided in the placeholder below.
* Use the outline, backlog, and guidelines as your blueprint for content, style, and structure.
* Always follow the structure: *story → research insight → script/tool → reflection/application* unless otherwise specified in the backlog.
* Integrate the listed **Genre Artifact** naturally into the draft.
* Maintain empathy, clarity, and practical usefulness throughout.
* Avoid therapy jargon unless defined.
* End the draft with either a reflection question, a takeaway sentence, or a micro-practice prompt that encourages application.

### Stylistic Rules (from `docs/Guidelines.md`)

* **POV:** Second person (“you”), with occasional first person plural (“we”).
* **Tone:** Compassionate, practical, validating, warm but firm.
* **Tense:** Present for guidance/tools; past for illustrative stories/research.
* **Voice:** Clear, concise, conversational, with memorable phrases and metaphors.
* **Pacing:** Digestible beats, short paragraphs, scripts in italicized blockquotes.
* **Chapter Length Target:** 6,000–7,500 words.
* **Section Length Target:** 2,000–2,500 words.

### Quality Checks

Before completing the draft, ensure:

1. **Coherence:** Story, insight, and tool flow logically.
2. **Consistency:** Signature tools (Pause-Label-Let, Boundary Breath, Repair without Retracting) remain stable in name and format.
3. **Voice:** Warm, empathetic, and practical—not clinical or distant.
4. **Pacing:** Story segments under 500 words, research clear and short, scripts highlighted, exercises simple.
