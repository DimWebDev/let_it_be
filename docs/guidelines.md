# docs/Guidelines.md### Point of View, Tone, and Tense

* **POV:** Second person ("you"), with occasional first person plural ("we") for solidarity. Direct address creates immediacy and intimacy.
* **Tone:** Compassionate, practical, and validating without slipping into jargon or therapy-speak. Always sound like a wise, empathetic guide who has been there.
* **Tone Adjectives:** Warm, firm, gentle, direct, encouraging, non-judgmental, empowering, authentic, relatable, trustworthy, clear-eyed, hopeful, realistic, transformative, liberating.
* **Theme Adjectives:** Boundary-setting as self-care, guilt as misfiring alarm, personal freedom through healthy limits, emotional intelligence in relationships, practical wisdom over perfectionism, compassionate self-advocacy, authentic connection through boundaries.

---ting Guidelines for *L* **Repetition for retention:** Key tools (Pause-Label-Let, Boundary Breath, Repair without Retracting) should reappear in multiple contexts so they become "sticky."
* **Empathy:** Validate reader struggle first, then introduce the tool. Example: "It makes sense you freeze up in the moment. Here's how to find your words again."

### Formatting Guidelines

* **Markdown:** Use standard markdown formatting. The manuscript will be rendered to EPUB and paperback.
* **No Emojis or Special Unicode:** Avoid emojis and decorative unicode characters that may cause encoding issues in print or digital formats. Use plain text and standard punctuation only.

### Point of View, Tone, and Tense

* **POV:** Second person (“you”), with occasional first person plural (“we”) for solidarity. Direct address creates immediacy and intimacy.
* **Tone:** Compassionate, practical, and validating without slipping into jargon or therapy-speak. Always sound like a wise, empathetic guide who has been there.
* **Tense:** Present tense for tools and guidance; past tense for illustrative stories and research examples.
* **Voice:** Clear, direct, concise. Short paragraphs. Accessible metaphors. Sentences that can be underlined and repeated.

---

### Word Count Targets

* **Chapters:** 6,000–7,500 words each.
* **Sections:** 2,000–2,500 words each.
* **Mini-segments (story, research, script demo):** 300–800 words.
* **Overall Book Length:** ~70,000 words.

### Four Universal Quality Checks

Every draft must include a **post-writing check** against these four standards:

1. **Coherence:** Does the section flow logically from story → insight → tool → application? Are transitions clear?
2. **Consistency:** Are the signature tools (Pause-Label-Let, Boundary Breath, Repair without Retracting) presented in the same structure throughout? Is terminology stable (no swapping “boundary breath” for “breathing break”)?
3. **Voice:** Does the writing sound warm but firm? Are sentences conversational but free of clichés?
4. **Pacing:** Is the section broken into digestible beats? Does it avoid dragging theory too long without returning to scripts or scenarios?

### Project-Specific Advice Rule

**Always frame guilt as a misfiring alarm, not as moral truth.** Every time guilt is mentioned, the draft must explicitly differentiate between values-based decisions and vibe-driven reactions. This is the unique intellectual thread of the book and must be visible across all chapters.

---

### Additional Style Instructions

* **Stories:** Begin sections with a vivid micro-story that illustrates the boundary challenge in real life. Maximum 500 words before pivoting to insight.
* **Research:** Anchor each chapter with at least one study, theory, or evidence-based concept. Keep explanations short (under 300 words) and immediately connect them to practice.
* **Scripts:** Every major section ends with a ready-to-use script, in italicized blockquote formatting for clarity.
* **Reflection Prompts:** Each chapter closes with 2–3 reflection questions or quick practices.
* **Accessibility:** Avoid therapy jargon unless explained (e.g., define “drama triangle” clearly before using the term repeatedly).
* **Repetition for retention:** Key tools (Pause-Label-Let, Boundary Breath, Repair without Retracting) should reappear in multiple contexts so they become “sticky.”
* **Empathy:** Validate reader struggle first, then introduce the tool. Example: “It makes sense you freeze up in the moment. Here’s how to find your words again.”
