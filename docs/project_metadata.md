## Project Metadata: *Let It Be, Let Me Be: Boundaries Without Guilt*

**Premise:** A practical field guide for saying “no” without guilt—teaching readers a compassionate, repeatable script for boundaries that avoids both rigidity and rumination.

**Genre:** Nonfiction – Self-Help / Psychology / Communication Skills

---

### Key Genre Conventions to Track

* **Personal Anecdotes + Research Pairing:** Each chapter must open with or include a short, relatable story, then anchor it with evidence from psychology, communication science, or organizational behavior.
* **Practical Tools:** Clear, concise, repeatable scripts and techniques the reader can directly practice.
* **Audience Identification:** Speak directly to over-functioners, people-pleasers, and those who experience guilt when asserting needs. The text should feel both empathetic and directive.
* **Applied Scenarios:** Concrete examples involving common power imbalances (boss/employee, parent/child, client/service provider).

### Definition of “Genre Artifact” for This Project

For this book, the **Genre Artifact** column in the outline will mark the **practical output tool** of each chapter (e.g., scripts, worksheets, short exercises, or framing devices). This ensures every section not only explains but equips.

### Additional Stylistic & Thematic Notes

* **Tone:** Compassionate but firm; a teacher who knows the traps of people-pleasing from the inside.
* **Voice:** Practical, uncluttered, emotionally validating without becoming therapeutic jargon.
* **Structure:** Each chapter should move: *story → research insight → script/tool → application scenario.*
* **Special Devices:** The signature scripts (“Pause-Label-Let,” “Boundary Breath,” “Repair without Retracting”) should repeat throughout as touchstones for memorability.
